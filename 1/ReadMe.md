# Global Temperature Trends â€” Data Exploration & Visualization

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global temperature anomaly data from NASA GISTEMP to explore climate trends over time. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create clear visualizations that highlight key patterns and insights in global temperature changes.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- **Pandas**: Data loading, cleaning, transformation, and aggregation
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations and data handling
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization and plotting
- **Basic EDA**: Data inspection, summary statistics, and trend analysis

## Workflow
1. **Data Loading**: Import global temperature anomaly data directly from NASA GISTEMP.
2. **Data Cleaning & Reshaping**: Prepare the dataset for analysis by handling missing values and converting formats.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Compute annual averages, rolling means, and identify top warmest years.
4. **Visualization**: Generate line plots and heatmaps to visually communicate temperature trends and anomalies.

## Outcome
- Gain insights into global climate change using real-world data.
- Develop skills in data wrangling and visualization with Python.
- Create visual reports that make climate trends easy to understand.
